# symmray

A minimal library for block sparse, abelian symetric and fermionic arrays,
designed to look as much as possible like standard ndarrays, backed by
`numpy`, `torch` or any other `autoray` compatible library.


## Installation


**Installing the latest version directly from github:**

If you want to checkout the latest version of features and fixes, you can
install directly from the github repository:
```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/jcmgray/symmray.git
```

**Installing a local, editable development version:**

If you want to make changes to the source code and test them out, you can
install a local editable version of the package:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcmgray/symmray.git
pip install --no-deps -U -e symmray/
```


## Usage

`symmray` objects are designed so that, as much as possible, one can interact
with them in the same way as standard arrays. You can use the functions from
the ``symmray`` namespace directly:

```python
import symmray as sr

z = sr.tensordot(x, y, axes=[(5, 2), (3, 7)])
```

or you can use the automatic dispatch library `autoray` to support multiple
backends including `symmray`:

```python
import autoray as ar

z = ar.do("tensordot", x, y, axes=[(5, 2), (3, 7)])
```

`symmray` also uses `autoray` internally to handle manipulating blocks within
an array, meaning that these can be `numpy`, `torch`, `jax` or any other
`autoray` compatible library.

Whilst block sparse arrays do not have such a well defined notion of shape as
dense arrays, for ease and compatibility with other libraries, `symmray` arrays
do have a `.shape` attribute which is the shape of the dense array that would
be returned by calling `to_dense` on the array, and a similarly defined
`.size`. Likewise, `symmray` supports fusing and unfusing of indices via
`reshape` (as long as it is clear what is meant by the new shape).

### Block sparse abelian symmetric arrays

The core `AbelianArray` object consists of 4 main components:

1. `.indices`: a sequence of `BlockIndex` instances describing the charge
   distribution and 'dualness' of each dimension.
2. `.charge`: an overall charge for the array, which sets which combinations
   of index charges ('sectors') are allowed.
3. `.blocks`: a dict mapping each non-zero sector to a 'raw' array.
4. `.symmetry`: an object defining allowed charges and how they combine.

Specific subclasses of `AbelianArray` have a static `.symmetry` class
attribute.

The `BlockIndex` object consists of 2 main components:

1. `.chargemap`: a dict mapping each charge to its size. The total size of the
   index is the sum of the sizes of all charges.
2. `.dual`: a boolean indicating whether the index is 'dual' or not. By
   convention:

    - `dual=False` means index flows 'outwards' / (+ve) / ket-like
    - `dual=True` means index flows 'inwards' / (-ve) / bra-like

One convenient way to create `AbelianArray` instances is via the `from_fill_fn`
method, which takes a function with signature `fn(shape) -> array_like` and
uses it to fill each valid sector of the array.

```python
import symmray as sr
import numpy as np

indices = (
    sr.BlockIndex(chargemap={0: 3, 1: 4}, dual=False),
    sr.BlockIndex(chargemap={0: 5, 1: 6}, dual=True),
)

x = sr.Z2Array.from_fill_fn(
    fill_fn=np.ones,
    indices=indices,
    charge=1,
)
x
# Z2Array(shape~(7, 11):[+-], charge=1, num_blocks=2)

x.blocks
# {(0,
#   1): array([[1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
#         [1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
#         [1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]]),
#  (1,
#   0): array([[1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
#         [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
#         [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.],
#         [1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]])}
```

We can pictorially represent this like so:

![simple-symmetric-array-pic](docs/images/simple-symmetric-array-pic.png)

You can also create `AbelianArray` instances using the methods:

- `AbelianArray(indices, charge, blocks)`
- `AbelianArray.from_blocks(blocks, duals, charges)` which calculates the
  index chargemaps from the sectors and blocks themselves.
- `AbelianArray.random(indices, charge)` which uses a random `fill_fn`
- `AbelianArray.from_dense(array, index_maps, duals, charge)` which converts
  a dense array to a block sparse array given a mapping for each axis, which
  specifies the charge of each linear index in the dense array.

Key functions which match the numpy versions are:

- `conj`
- `reshape`
- `tensordot`
- `trace`
- `transpose`

With additional `symmray` specific key functions:

- `fuse`
- `multiply_diagonal`

Fuse in particular is a crucial function for A. performing efficient
contractions, B. performing linear algebra decompositions, as well as various
other tensor network manipulations. You can either fuse and unfuse directly, or
by using `reshape`. Note that if a `symmray` array is quite sparse (e.g. with
U1 symmetry), then the resulting fused/reshaped shape will not necessarily
match the dense specification.

The key function `tensordot` can use one of two methods.

- `tensordot(x, y, axes, method="fused")`: fuse the two arrays into block
  diagonal matrices and then unfuse the result. This can be much faster, though
  possibly requires explicitly filling missing blocks with zeros.
- `tensordot(x, y, axes, method="blockwise")`: compute the contraction by
  directly looping over the blocks of `x` and `y` and contracting them. This
  has quite high overhead for large numbers of blocks.


### Fermionic arrays

The approach to fermionic arrays `symmray` takes is equivalent to the
'Grassmann' or graded algebra approach. This associates a fermionic parity to
each charge, combined with the directionality specified by `dual`, allows
all fermionic swaps and the relevant sector phase changes to be handled
essentially locally.

The core `FermionicArray` is a subclass of `AbelianArray` and instantiated in
the same way:

```python
indices = (
    sr.BlockIndex(chargemap={-1: 2, 0: 2, 1: 3}, dual=False),
    sr.BlockIndex(chargemap={0: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4}, dual=True),
)

x = sr.U1FermionicArray.random(
    indices=indices,
    charge=-2,
)
print(x)
# U1FermionicArray(ndim=2, charge=-2, indices=[
#     (7 = 2+2+3 : +[-1,0,1])
#     (9 = 2+3+4 : -[0,2,3])
# ], num_blocks=2, backend=numpy, dtype=float64)
```

Phases are lazily tracked into the attribute `.phases` when:

- transposing
- fusing
- conjugating
- contracting via tensordot or `__matmul__` / `@`
- tracing
- linear algebra decompositions

via the methods:

- `FermionicArray.phase_flip`: virtually insert 'parity' tensors on some axes
- `FermionicArray.phase_transpose`: compute the phase of a 'virtual' transpose

And inserted when needed using:

- `FermionicArray.phase_sync`: actually multiply the blocks by the phases.

#### Multiple odd-parity fermionic arrays - `oddpos`

If you want to work with networks involving multiple odd-parity tensors then
you must supply a non-zero integer index `oddpos` to the `FermionicArray`
constructor, which acts like a sequence of dummy indices with odd-parity.
Whenever two arrays with `oddpos` are contracted, a global phase
is possibly inserted coming from sorting these dummy odd-parity indices.

An initial integer value of ``oddpos`` is converted into a length 1 tuple, and
these are then concatenated and sorted when two arrays are contracted. For
example, if `a` and `b` have accrued the following `oddpos` values:
```
oddpos_a = (2, 3, 5)
oddpos_b = (4, 6,)
```
their contraction would result in:
```
(2, 3, 5, 4, 6)
-> sort introduces phase ->
(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
-> neighboring oddpos pairs can then be cancelled ->
oddpos_new = (6,)
```

This gives a canonical sign to the overall network that is handled
automatically and locally (once the initial `oddpos` values are chosen.)
The phase is tracked lazily via `FermionicArray.phase_global`.


#### Conjugation and tensor networks

Conjugating a fermionic array is handled by the `.conj()` method, with two
notable options, `phase_permutation=True` by default and `phase_dual=False` by
default. The former applies phases as if we had reversed the order of axes
(though we don't change the data layout). The latter applies 'virtual' parity
tensors to dual indices, which can be desired if they are the 'dangling' legs
of a tensor network.

By default, only the first happens. This implies if you have a tensor network
wavefunction $|\psi\rangle$ where all *dangling* indices are ket-like
(dual=False), then conjugating each tensor locally gives you the bra
wavefunction $\langle\psi|$ such that the contraction $\langle\psi|\psi\rangle$
yields the norm squared of the wavefunction.

If the tensor network has both bra-like and ket-like dangling indices
(e.g. in the infinite setting or using cluster approximations), then the
dangling dual legs of the conjugated network must be explicitly phase-flipped.

For example, in the following network:

![tn-conjugate-phase](docs/images/tn-conjugate-phase.png)

the only index that needs to be phase-flipped beyond `phase_permutation` is the
orange dangling 'ket' index in the bra $\langle\psi|$, indicated by the red
diamond.


#### Local fermionic operators

Many tensor network algorithms involve applying local fermionic operators to
the wavefunction. Such local operators need to be expressed in a local basis
with a particular ordering and resulting phases. `symmray` provides several
common operators:

- `fermi_hubbard_local_array`
- `fermi_hubbard_spinless_local_array`

 plus lower level functions for building custom ones:

- `build_local_fermionic_array`
- `build_local_fermionic_elements`

These latter functions take a specification of `terms`, which is a sequence of tuples of the
form `(coeff, ops)` where `ops` is a sequence of symbolic `FermionicOperator`
objects, (or equivalent pair `(label, op)`).

Secondly they take a specification of `bases`. This is a sequence of each local
basis, each a sequence of `FermionicOperator` objects.

For example, imagine we want to build the term:

$$8 n_a n_b  - 2 (n_a + n_b)= 8 a^\dagger a b^\dagger b - 2 a^\dagger a - 2 b^\dagger b$$

into an array with elements defined:

$$o = \langle i' | \langle j' | \hat O | i \rangle | j \rangle$$

where the two bases are given by: $| i \rangle = \{|0\rangle, a^\dagger|0\rangle\}$ and $| j \rangle = \{|0\rangle, b^\dagger|0\rangle\}$. We can build this operator as follows:

```python
a, b = map(sr.FermionicOperator, 'ab')
# you can also use strings or pairs like
# adag = 'a+' or ('a', '+')
# a    = 'a-' or ('a', '-')

terms = [
    (+8, (a.dag, a, b.dag, b)),
    (-2, (a.dag, a)),
    (-2, (b.dag, b)),
]

bases = [
    [(), (a.dag,)],
    [(), (b.dag,)],
]

# get just the non-zero elements (with phases)
sr.build_local_fermionic_elements(
    terms, bases
)
# {(0, 1, 0, 1): -2.0, (1, 0, 1, 0): -2.0, (1, 1, 1, 1): -4.0}
```

To build an actual fermionic array we need to specify a symmetry and a `index_map` for each local basis that maps each index to a charge. For example, if we want to build the above operator into a `U1FermionicArray` we could do:

```python
sr.build_local_fermionic_array(
    terms,
    bases,
    symmetry="U1",
    index_maps=[
        (0, 1),  # charges for basis i
        (0, 1),  # charges for basis j
    ]
)
# U1FermionicArray(shape~(2, 2, 2, 2):[++--], charge=0, num_blocks=6)
```

Fermi-hubbard and spinless fermi-hubbard operators have built-in local functions:
```python
sr.fermi_hubbard_local_array("U1U1", t=1.0, U=8.0, mu=5).blocks
# {((0, 0), (0, 0), (0, 0), (0, 0)): array([[[[0.]]]]),
#  ((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1)): array([[[[-5.]]]]),
#  ((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0)): array([[[[-1.]]]]),
#  ((0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0)): array([[[[-5.]]]]),
#  ((0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)): array([[[[-1.]]]]),
#  ((0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1)): array([[[[-2.]]]]),

#  ((0, 1), (0, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)): array([[[[-1.]]]]),
#  ((0, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0)): array([[[[-5.]]]]),
#  ((0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1)): array([[[[10.]]]]),
#  ((0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1)): array([[[[-1.]]]]),
#  ((0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)): array([[[[10.]]]]),
#  ((0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)): array([[[[0.]]]]),
#  ((0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0)): array([[[[-1.]]]]),
#  ((0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1)): array([[[[-7.]]]]),
#  ((0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)): array([[[[1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0)): array([[[[-1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)): array([[[[-5.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1)): array([[[[1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0)): array([[[[0.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1)): array([[[[10.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 0)): array([[[[1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (1, 0), (1, 0), (1, 0)): array([[[[10.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)): array([[[[-7.]]]]),
#  ((1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)): array([[[[1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (0, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1)): array([[[[0.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)): array([[[[1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)): array([[[[-1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0)): array([[[[-2.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1)): array([[[[1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)): array([[[[-7.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)): array([[[[1.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0)): array([[[[-7.]]]]),
#  ((1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)): array([[[[-4.]]]])}
```

(Note that zero blocks are stored - for the sake of correctness when fusing and exponentiating.) The spinful versions uses the local basis:

$$
|i\rangle =
\{|00\rangle, c_{\downarrow}|00\rangle, c_{\uparrow}|00\rangle, c_{\uparrow}c_{\downarrow}|00\rangle\}
$$

which has a U1 `index_map` of charges `[0, 1, 1, 2]` or a U1U1 `index_map` of
charges `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]`.

Both `fermi_hubbard_local_array` and `fermi_hubbard_spinless_local_array` also take a `coordinations` argument which specifies the lattice coordination of the two sites. This scales any *on-site* (i.e. 1-local) terms by inverse coordination, so that these terms can be included in the pairwise (i.e. 2-local) arrays without overcounting. For example in a 1D open chain the boundary `coordinations` would be `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`, whereas the bulk would be `(2, 2)`. The utility function
`sr.utis.parse_edges_to_site_info` fills in coordination information.
